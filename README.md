## Description
Every good project requires a professional looking README file to let everyone know what your project is and how to use it. This is a Command Line (CLI) application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project.

## Installation
To install the README Generator, 'Git Clone' the repo to a local instance. In your terminal ensure you are in the appropriate directory and run 'npm install' from the CLI which will install 'Inquirer' which is specified from the dependencies in the 'package.json' file.
